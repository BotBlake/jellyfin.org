# Installation on Synology

:::caution Pre-built NAS Devices

Many pre-built NAS devices are underpowered. We generally do not recommend running Jellyfin on those devices.
See: [Hardware Selection](/docs/general/administration/hardware-selection) for more information.

:::
For [Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm), Jellyfin is installed using Docker. For this guide, the Synology Container Manager will be used to install Jellyfin.

## Prerequisites

Everything is done through the Synology web interface.
This guide assumes you have already set up your Synology NAS and have access to the web interface. And your Synology NAS is running DSM 7.0 or newer.
Install the "Container Manager" package from the Synology Package Center.
<<<<<<< HEAD
To do this you need to open the Package Center and search for "Container Manager" and install it.
For further information read this [guide](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/PkgManApp/install_buy?version=7).
=======
Open the Package Center and search for "Container Manager" to find the package.

## Installation

The installation is done with the Synology Container Manager.
If you don't see the icon in the main menu after the installation of `Container Manager`, it can be found by clicking the top left corner of the main menu.

### Downloading the Jellyfin Image

Navigate to the "Registry" tab and search for "Jellyfin". You should see the official jellyfin/jellyfin image. Click on it and then click "Download".

A new window will open and a Jellyfin version can be selected for install. The latest version is recommended. Click `Apply` after selection a version.

After the image is downloaded, it can be found in the `Image` tab.

### Creating the Container

Navigate to the `Container` tab and click `Create`.
Select the "Jellyfin" image and give the container a name. We recommend using "Jellyfin" as the name. You can also set the container to auto-start if you want Jellyfin to start when the NAS boots.
Resource limits can also be set for the container. It is recommended that all CPU resources and at least 4GB of ram be allocated to the Jellyfin container.
Click `Next` to proceed to the next step.

#### Port Settings

Allocate ports to the container. Jellyfin uses port 8096 for the web interface and 1900 for DLNA by default. It is recommended to use the default ports if they are not being used by other services.

#### Volume Settings

You need to set the volume settings for the container. Jellyfin needs access to your media files and configuration files.
To add a volume, click "Add Folder" and select the folder you want to use. In the middle column, you need to set the mount path. For the media files, you can use "/media" and for the configuration files, you can use "/config".

#### Network Settings
Set how the container connects to the network. DLNA requires `Host` mode to function.

Any other settings can be left as default.
Your settings should look like this:

Click `Next` to proceed to the next step.

Settings can be reviewed at this screen. Check the `Run this container after the wizard is finished` checkbox and click `Apply` if everything looks correct. The container should now be shown in the `Container` tab.

Browse to `http://SERVER_IP:8096` in a browser on a other device to finish setting up the Jellyfin server.
If a different port was used, replace `8096` with the port used instead.
